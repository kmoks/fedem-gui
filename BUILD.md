# FEDEM GUI Build

Currently, we support building on Windows only,
using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or later,
and with Intel&reg; Fortran Compilers for the Fortran modules.
The build system is based on the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) tool,
which is embedded in the Visual Studio 2019 installation.

See [below](#build-fedem-gui-application-on-linux) for ongoing effort to
build the GUI application on Linux.

## Build of external 3rd-party modules

Before you can build the FEDEM GUI itself, you first need to build and install
some 3rd-party open source components which are not included in this repository.
Detailed instructions on how to do that for each package, is provided below.

### Qt

The [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/product/framework) is a huge package,
and FEDEM only uses a small part of it. The following description therefore
focuses on the necessary steps to build only what is needed for FEDEM usage.

To build and install the components needed by FEDEM on Windows,
proceed as follows. The description below assumes you're using version 6.5.0
for which the FEDEM build process has been tested, but it may also apply
for later versions with minor modifications.

- Clone the top-level Qt module from the git repository:

      cd ~/Fedem-src
      git clone git://code.qt.io/qt/qt5.git Qt6

- Checkout the 6.5.0 branch:

      cd Qt6
      git checkout 6.5.0

- FEDEM only requires the `qtbase` submodule of Qt,
  so to clone the corresponding branch for that:

      ./init-repository --branch --module-subset=qtbase

- Comment out the freetype subdirectory from `qtbase/src/3rdparty/CMakeLists.txt`,
  as this may not build and is not needed by FEDEM anyway, i.e.:

      12c12
      <     add_subdirectory(freetype)
      ---
      > #    add_subdirectory(freetype)

- With Visual Studio 2019, configure the Qt build by executing the following
  commands from a DOS shell (put this in a bat-file for the convenience):

      @echo off
      title Qt6 configuration
      call "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
      mkdir %USERPROFILE%\Qt6-build\qtbase
      cd %USERPROFILE%\Qt6-build\qtbase
      call %USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\Qt6\qtbase\configure.bat ^
      -top-level -release -prefix C:\Qt-6.5.0 ^
      -nomake examples -nomake tests ^
      -no-dbus -no-ssl -no-openssl -no-harfbuzz -no-gif -no-libjpeg ^
      -no-freetype -qt-zlib
      pause

- Build and install Qt:

      cd %USERPROFILE%\Qt6-build
      cmake --build . --parallel
      cmake --install .

### Coin

FEDEM uses the [Coin3D](https://www.coin3d.org/) package,
to implement its *3D Modeler view*.
It consists of several github projects, of which four are used in FEDEM.

To build and install the main component (Coin), proceed as follows:

- Download the sources from [github](https://github.com/coin3d/coin).
  We have been using
  [Coin 4.0.0](https://github.com/coin3d/coin/releases/tag/Coin-4.0.0),
  but recently two updates were released (4.0.1 and 4.0.2), so you may want
  to try out the latest release instead.
  Choose the file `coin-4.0.0-src.zip`
  (or the equivalent `.tar.gz` file) if you go for the 4.0.0 version.

- Unzip the sources in arbitrary location,
  e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\Coin-4.0.0`.

- Download the latest [boost](https://www.boost.org/) package.
  Currently, this is
  [boost 1.83.0](https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.83.0/source/).
  Choose the file `boost_1_83_0.zip` (or the equivalent `.tar.gz` file).
  The whole package contains more than 80000 files, but Coin uses only a small
  fraction of it. So to save time (and disk space), you may choose to extract
  only the necessary parts. Using the `unzip` tool in a bash shell, that is:

      cd ~/Fedem-src
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/*.hpp'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/assert/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/concept/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/container/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/config/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/core/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/detail/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/exception/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/iterator/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/lexical_cast/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/move/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/mpl/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/numeric/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/preprocessor/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/range/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/smart_ptr/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/type_traits/**'
      unzip ~/Downloads/boost_1_83_0.zip 'boost_1_83_0/boost/utility/**'

  This will extract less than 3000 files, which is sufficient for building Coin.

- Comment out line 818 in the file `~/Fedem-src/Coin-4.0.0/CMakeLists.txt`
  which adds the sub-directory `cpack.d` to the build, that is:

      818c818
      < add_subdirectory(cpack.d)
      ---
      > #add_subdirectory(cpack.d)

- With Visual Studio 2019, configure the Coin build by executing the following
  commands from a DOS shell (put this in a bat-file for the convenience):

      @echo off
      title Coin configuration
      call "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
      "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe" ^
      -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ^
      -S %USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\Coin-4.0.0 ^
      -B %USERPROFILE%\Coin-build\Coin ^
      -DBOOST_ROOT=%USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\boost_1_83.0 ^
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\Coin-4 ^
      -DCOIN_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
      pause

- Open the generated solution file `%USERPROFILE%\Coin-build\Coin\Coin.sln`
  in Visual Studio and build the `INSTALL` target for `Release` configuration.

### SoQt

This is a coupling module between Coin and Qt,
and can therefore be built only *after* you have installed those two modules.

To build and install SoQt, proceed as follows:

- Download the sources from [github](https://github.com/coin3d/soqt).
  Use the latest release [SoQt 1.6.2](https://github.com/coin3d/soqt/releases/tag/soqt-v1.6.2),
  and choose the file `soqt-1.6.2-src.zip` (or the equivalent `.tar.gz` file).

- Unzip the sources in arbitrary location,
  e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\SoQt-1.6.2`.

- With Visual Studio 2019, configure the SoQt build by executing the following
  commands from a DOS shell (put this in a bat-file for the convenience):

      @echo off
      title SoQt configuration
      call "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
      "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe" ^
      -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ^
      -S %USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\SoQt ^
      -B %USERPROFILE%\Coin-build\SoQt ^
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\Coin-4 ^
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Qt-6.5.0 ^
      -DSOQT_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
      pause

- Open the generated solution file `%USERPROFILE%\Coin-build\SoQt\SoQt.sln`
  in Visual Studio and build the `INSTALL` target for `Release` configuration.

### SmallChange

The lastest release on github is not compatible with Qt 6.
Therefore, we need to build this package from HEAD of the master branch.
To do this proceeed as follows:

- Clone the sources from the github repository:

      cd ~/Fedem-src
      git clone git@github.com:coin3d/smallchange.git SmallChange

- With Visual Studio 2019, configure the SmallChange build
  by executing the following commands from a DOS shell
  (put this in a bat-file for the convenience):

      @echo off
      title SmallChange configuration
      call "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
      "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe" ^
      -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ^
      -S %USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\SmallChange ^
      -B %USERPROFILE%\Coin-build\SmallChange ^
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\Coin-4 ^
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Qt-6.5.0
      pause

- Open the generated solution file
  `%USERPROFILE%\Coin-build\SoQt\SmallChange.sln`
  in Visual Studio and build the `INSTALL` target for `Release` configuration.

### Simage

This library is only used for exporting images and animations from FEDEM. If
those features are not important, you may skip the following installation steps:

- Download the sources from [github](https://github.com/coin3d/simage).
  Use the latest release
  [Simage 1.8.3](https://github.com/coin3d/simage/releases/tag/v1.8.3),
  and choose the file `simage-1.8.3-src.zip` (or the equivalent `.tar.gz` file).

- Unzip the sources in arbitrary location,
  e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\Simage-1.8.3`.

- With Visual Studio 2019, configure the Simage build by executing the following
  commands from a DOS shell (put this in a bat-file for the convenience):

      @echo off
      title Simage configuration
      call "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
      "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe" ^
      -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ^
      -S %USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\Simage-1.8.3 ^
      -B %USERPROFILE%\Coin-build\Simage ^
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\Coin-4 ^
      -DSIMAGE_LIBSNDFILE_SUPPORT=OFF ^
      -DSIMAGE_OGGVORBIS_SUPPORT=OFF ^
      -DSIMAGE_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF ^
      -DSIMAGE_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
      pause

- Open the generated solution file `%USERPROFILE%\Coin-build\Simage\simage.sln`
  in Visual Studio and build the `INSTALL` target for `Release` configuration.

- Move the `simage.h` header file into right place:

      cd C:\Coin-4.0.0\include
      mkdir Simage
      move simage.h Simage

### Zlib

The [zlib](https://zlib.net/) package is needed only if you activate building
with Digital Twin features, using the command-line option `-DUSE_DIGTWIN=ON`,
as explained [here](README.md#activation-of-features-compile-time). It is used
for exporting models to *FMUs* and *EPD Connected Products* apps. So if you
don't need this feature, you can skip the following installation procedure:

- Download the zlib sources from [github](https://github.com/madler/zlib).
  We have tested this with
  [zlib 1.2.13](https://github.com/madler/zlib/releases/tag/v1.2.13),
  but any newer releases will probably work as well.

- Unzip the sources in arbitrary location,
  e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\zlib-1.2.13`

- Append the following to their `CMakeLists.txt` file:

      #=========================================================================
      # minizip
      #=========================================================================
      set(ZIP_PUBLIC_HDRS
          contrib/minizip/zip.h
          contrib/minizip/ioapi.h
          contrib/minizip/iowin32.h
      )
      set(ZIP_PRIVATE_HDRS
          contrib/minizip/crypt.h
      )
      set(ZIP_SRCS
          contrib/minizip/zip.c
          contrib/minizip/ioapi.c
          contrib/minizip/iowin32.c
      )
      message(STATUS "Adding zip library")
      add_library(zip STATIC ${ZIP_SRCS} ${ZIP_PUBLIC_HDRS} ${ZIP_PRIVATE_HDRS})
      if(NOT SKIP_INSTALL_LIBRARIES AND NOT SKIP_INSTALL_ALL)
        install(TARGETS zip
                RUNTIME DESTINATION "${INSTALL_BIN_DIR}"
                ARCHIVE DESTINATION "${INSTALL_LIB_DIR}"
                LIBRARY DESTINATION "${INSTALL_LIB_DIR}" )
      endif()
      if(NOT SKIP_INSTALL_HEADERS AND NOT SKIP_INSTALL_ALL)
        install(FILES ${ZIP_PUBLIC_HDRS} DESTINATION "${INSTALL_INC_DIR}")
      endif()

  This will configure for building the `zip` library based on the `minizip`
  sources, in addition to the `zlib` library itself, when `cmake` is executed.

- With Visual Studio 2019, configure the zlib build by executing the following
  commands from a DOS shell (put this in a bat-file for the convenience):

      @echo off
      title zlib configuration
      call "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
      "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe" ^
      -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ^
      -S %USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\zlib-1.2.13 ^
      -B %USERPROFILE%\zlib-build ^
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\Zlib
      pause

- Open the generated solution file `%USERPROFILE%\zlib-build\zlib.sln`
  in Visual Studio and build the `INSTALL` target for `Release` configuration.

## Build the FEDEM GUI application

With the necessary third-party modules installed,
as described [above](#build-of-external-3rd-party-modules),
it is straight forward to configure and build the FEDEM GUI itself,
Proceed as follows:

- From a bash shell or command prompt, clone the sources of this repository:

      cd ~/Fedem-src
      git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:openfedem/fedem-gui.git

- Configure for build in Visual Studio 2019 using `CMake`,
  e.g., execute the following bat script:

      @echo off
      title Fedem GUI configuration
      call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" intel64 vs2019
      set COIN_ROOT=C:\Coin-4
      set QT_ROOT=C:\Qt-6.5.0
      set /p VERSION=<%USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\fedem-gui\cfg\VERSION
      "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe" ^
      -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ^
      -S %USERPROFILE%\Fedem-src\fedem-gui ^
      -B %USERPROFILE%\Fedem-build\fedemGUI ^
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%USERPROFILE%\Fedem-install\%VERSION% ^
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%QT_ROOT% ^
      -DUSE_FORTRAN=ON
      pause

  If you don't have the Intel&reg; Fortran Compilers installed,
  you have to replace the call statement above by

      call "%VS2019INSTALLDIR%\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64

  and remove the option `-DUSE_FORTRAN=ON`.
  It will then configure without Fortran support.
  This implies that the *Previewing of Functions* feature will not be available
  in your build of FEDEM GUI. You can also specify any of the options listed
  [here](README.md#activation-of-features-compile-time) in a similar way,
  to tailor your build further.

- Open the generated solution file
  `%USERPROFILE%\Fedem-build\fedemGUI\fedemGUI.sln`
  in Visual Studio and build the `Fedem` target for `Release` configuration
  to compile all source files.

  Build the `INSTALL` target to install the resulting binaries
  (`.exe` file and dependent `.dll` files) and some other files in the folder
  `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}\bin` where `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is specified
  on the `cmake` command (see above). The binaries will then be installed
  in a subfolder named after the current version stored in the
  [cfg\VERSION](cfg/VERSION) file.

## Build new FEDEM installation

  To build a complete installer for FEDEM with the GUI and solver modules,
  you first need to build the `INSTALL` target of this project
  as described [above](#build-the-fedem-gui-application), as well as for
  the parallel projects [fedem-solvers](https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-solvers)
  and [fedem-mdb](https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-mdb). Finally, you need to build
  the end-user documentation in [fedem-docs](https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-docs).

  Make sure that all four projects use the same installation destination,
  by setting the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable to the same value for all
  when running the `cmake` configuration steps.

  When you have completed these tasks, you can build a zip-file installer
  for distribution of the FEDEM package by executing the script
  [Install\createInstaller.bat](Install/createInstaller.bat).
  You may need to edit this script first to specify the version tag and
  location of the compiled binaries (i.e., line 11 and 13):

      10 REM Edit the following line according to the version to create installer for:
      11 SET VERSION=8.0.0
      12 REM All binaries are assumed to have been built and placed in folder %INST_DIR%.
      13 SET INST_DIR=%USERPROFILE%\Fedem-install\3.0.1\bin

## Build FEDEM GUI application on Linux

It is possible to configure and build the GUI application on Linux as well.
The following configuration steps has been used so far:

- System: Ubuntu 22.04 with gcc 11.4

- Qt packages: Install Qt 6.2 and dependencies using the package manager

      sudo apt install libqt6core6 libqt6gui6 libqt6widgets6 libqt6opengl6
      sudo apt install libvulkan-dev libxkbcommon-dev

- Coin3D: Download the latest release from github. The binary package
  [coin-4.0.2-Ubuntu2204-gcc11-x64](https://github.com/coin3d/coin/releases/download/v4.0.2/coin-4.0.2-Ubuntu2204-gcc11-x64.tar.gz)
  can be used, unless you want to compile from the sources
  [coin-4.0.2-src](https://github.com/coin3d/coin/releases/download/v4.0.2/coin-4.0.2-src.tar.gz).
  Extract the binary package in arbitrary location, e.g., under `/usr/local/Coin3D`

- SoQt: Download the latest version from github.
  No binary package built with Qt 6 for Ubuntu is available, so here you need to build from the sources
  [soqt-1.6.2-src](https://github.com/coin3d/soqt/releases/download/v1.6.2/soqt-1.6.2-src.tar.gz):

      tar zxfv ~/Downloads/soqt-1.6.2-src.tar.gz
      mkdir soqt/Release
      cd soqt/Release
      cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/Coin3D -DSOQT_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
      make
      sudo make install

  The `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable has to point to the location where you chose to extract the Coin package.

- Smallchange: The lastest release on github is not compatible with Qt 6.
  Therefore, we need to build this package from HEAD of the master branch:

      git clone git@github.com:coin3d/smallchange.git
      mkdir smallchange/Release
      cd smallchange/Release
      cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/Coin3D
      make
      sudo make install

- Configure and build FEDEM GUI from the kmokstad/qt6-port branch:

      git clone -b qt6-port git@github.com:kmokstad/fedem-gui.git
      mkdir fedem-gui/Release fedem-gui/Debug
      cd fedem-gui/Release
      COIN_ROOT=/usr/local/Coin3D cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_QWTLIB=OFF
      make
      cd ../Debug
      COIN_ROOT=/usr/local/Coin3D cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DUSE_QWTLIB=OFF
      make
